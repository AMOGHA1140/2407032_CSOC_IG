## What are the files all about?

`mapping.json` - Contains the mapping from "class number" to "class name" for caltech-256 dataset (1-indexed numbering)

`mnist_cnn.ipynb` - my implementation of CNNs on MNIST database with almost 99% test accuracy.

`main.py` - implementation of custom functions used throughout the project

`resnet18_scratch_caltech.ipynb` - using the default resnet18 from torchvision.models, but training from scratch on just caltech256. 

`resnet28_self_implementation.ipynb` - implementing the architecture similar to resnet18, but using bottleneck layers instead of simple ones, same number of times as in resnet18.
