data_analysis.ipynb - finding basic distributions in the data, relations between them, trying new features
mnist.ipynb - a neural network on the mnist database. It was there just to make sure that my custom model worked properly because the actual dataset of medical no shows was unbalanced
my_model.ipynb - my model on the medical no show dataset
pytorch.ipynb - pytorch implementation on medical no show dataset
tensorflow.ipynb - it was just me trying out random stuff before learning pytorch, while I was creating my classes. It was just to cross check the accuracies etc
Artificial_Neural_Networks_report.pdf - the final report for submission
main.py - contains the main classes and functions for my custom implementation of neural networks
training_slowdown_after_epoch35.jpeg - you'll see its mention in the report
